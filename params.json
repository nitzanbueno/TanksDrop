{"name":"Tanksdrop","tagline":"A C# XNA Game with tanks that put fences and other stuff.","body":"[INTRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nThis game is my take at the old 'Tanks' game trend.\r\n\r\nThe game starts with 2-4 players who each have a tank on a square board, and they can move the tank around using the keyboard keys.\r\nThe square board is 'spherical' for tanks: any tank who goes from one side comes out the other.\r\nEach tank starts out on a different corner of the board and a customizable color.\r\nSIDENOTE: There are 8 colors to choose from: Red, Green, Blue, Aqua, Purple, Pink, Yellow and Orange.\r\n\r\nThe game's point is to stay the last one on the board by eliminating other tanks using bullets.\r\nAfter you are the last one on the board, the game waits for 3 seconds to avoid 'photo-finishes', and furthermore, even freezes for 1 second after the game ended,\r\nso you get to see that sweet victory frame.\r\nAND if you die during these 3 seconds, they have served their purpose: no one gets a point.\r\n\r\nBullets, in-code, are more commonly called 'Projectiles', as certain projectiles are not actually bullets, but rather missiles and such.\r\nProjectiles, normally, last 10 seconds (can be changed) and each tank can have up to 3 bullets at a time on the board (also changeable - see Settings section).\r\n\r\nThe tanks also have a defence mechanism - Fences!\r\nA tank can both shoot projectiles and place fences.\r\nFences look like thick lines with the same color as their placer's tank.\r\nFences are made to deflect projectiles, so when a tank places a fence, it creates a projectile-proof wall.\r\n(Of course, for some projectiles, it's not enough.)\r\nIt is also tank-proof, so tanks cannot go through it (although I have seen some cases where a tank glitches into a fence).\r\nLike projectiles, fences also last for 10 seconds by default, and each tank has a limit of 3 simultaneous fences on the board.\r\nIn the future, fences will have different effects, but right now, just good ol' fences.\r\n\r\nNext in line, we have power-ups.\r\nPower-ups divide into three obvious groups, all of which inherit the main PowerUp class.\r\n\r\nFirst, The Instants:\r\nThe instant power-ups (classes that inherit the InstantPowerUp class) are picked up by tanks and when they get picked up, they do nothing.\r\nWhen the player wants to use them, he will push the 'place fence' button and then their effect will happen.\r\nEffects include swpping places with other tanks and reflecting all bullets (turning them 180 degrees).\r\nInstant power-ups are usable any time after taking them. (EVEN if you are dead!)\r\n\r\nNext, we have the Timed:\r\nThe Timed power-ups (classes that inherit the TimedPowerUp class) are the most familiar type of power-ups.\r\nLike Invincibilty for instance, timed power-ups are taken by the player, and give its tank a special ability for a finite amount of time.\r\nI don't need to list any examples, as you probably know, but the invincibility I mentioned earlier if implemented in 2 ways.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the Appearing power-ups!\r\nThese power-ups which inherit the AppearingPowerUp class are unique and don't appear in many games.\r\nThese power-ups cannot be taken, but rather 'recycled'.\r\nThink of it like a button, which when you step over it, something happens, but it stays there.\r\nAppearing power-ups come in all shapes and sizes, so examples aren't gonna explain much, but one example is the badly-written Portal.\r\nYou go through one, and come out the other.\r\n\r\nNext up, we have Sudden Deaths!\r\nSudden Deaths occur after a set amount of time has passed that the players agree is too long for one match.\r\nThe goal of sudden deaths is to kill everybody because the match is too long.\r\nYou probaly know that, but sudden deaths aim to make everybody play an almost equal amount of time, and not sit in the side as 2 self-proclaimed 'Pros' shoot away for 10 minutes.\r\nSudden deaths kill in funny, awesome and sometimes weird ways, and are guaranteed to kill everyone within 20 seconds. (If no one dies of conventional ways, they just simply disappear.)\r\nThere is a list of sudden deaths below, but I recommend being surprised ;)\r\n\r\nThe players each have 6 keys which can be customized:\r\nForward - moves forward\r\nBack - moves backward\r\nLeft - rotates left\r\nRight - rotates right\r\nPlace - either places fence or activates power-up.\r\nShoot - shoots the tank's pending bullet.\r\n\r\n[SETTINGS]\r\n\r\nAnother very important part of the game is the Settings file.\r\nThe settings file is in the bin/x86/debug folder, along with the exe to play the game.\r\nIn the settings file, you will find many settings, so i made up a list for you so you won't get lost.\r\n\r\nPlayers - Straightforward, number of players. Between 2 to 4, I still don't have a good AI :(\r\n\r\nFenceLimit - Maximum amount of fences one tank can place simultaneously in milliseconds. Negative=Infinity.\r\n\r\nFenceTimeLimit - The amount of time a fence stays on board before despawning in milliseconds. Negative=Infinity.\r\n\r\nShotLimit - Maximum amount of projectiles one tank can shoot simultaneously in milliseconds. Negative=Infinity.\r\n\r\nShotTimeLimit - The amount of time a projectile stays on board before despawning in milliseconds. Negative=Infinity.\r\n\r\nEndingDelay - The amount of time to wait after one or zero tanks have remained on the board in milliseconds.\r\n\r\nFreezeTime - The amount of time to have the game freeze at the winning frame in milliseconds. I believe too long of a time there can cause 'Not Responding' errors.\r\n\r\nScreenWidth and ScreenHeight - Used to set the screen width and height in pixels. Primary goal is to shrink the window for low resolution screens.\r\n\r\nTankScale - Normally 2, it makes the tanks smaller or bigger. The precise size is 32*TankScale in pixels for one tank. Can also be fractions like 2.5.\r\n\r\nPickupTime - How often, in milliseconds, does one pickup spawn. for instance, 5000 means one pickup every 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nPickupDuration - How long, in milliseconds, does one pickup stay on board. (Does not apply for how long one power-up stays on the tank.)\r\n\r\nSuddenDeathAfter - The amount of time, in seconds, until sudden death occurs. Negative=Infinity.\r\n\r\nTankSpeed - Simply, the speed of the tank. I cannot really put my finger on how much that is, but you know, more is faster, less is slower. Can also be fractions.\r\n\r\nBulletSpeed - The speed of the bullets. Usually make that greater than the tank's, or else they would just die if they shoot while moving forwards. Can also be fractions.\r\n\r\nBlastRadius - The radius of explosion booms. Scaled 32 * BlastRadius. Can also be fractions.\r\n\r\nSpeedBoostFactor - How faster does a speed boost make the tank. For instance, 2 is 2x faster. Can also be fractions.\r\n\r\nPlayer1Keys,Player2Keys etc. - Keys to set. 6 keys, separated by commas, arranged: Up,Left,Right,Down,Place Fence,Shoot.\r\nYou probably want to take a look at the Microsoft XNA Keys Enum to put your non-letter keys at this link : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.input.keys.aspx\r\nYou can also leave these if you like them.\r\n\r\nPlayer1Color, Player2Color etc. - Sets each player's color. However, these can only be 8 colors: Red, Green, Blue, Aqua, Purple, Pink, Yellow and Orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n[POWER UPS]\r\n\r\nWe got there! Here is the list of power-ups.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll start from the instants:\r\n\r\nDeflector - Looks like a green 'recycle' sign.\r\nWhen Used, turns all bullets 180 degrees, so if a tank shot them and didn't move, it will come back to their face.\r\n\r\nDisabler - Looks like a red X.\r\nWhen used, it removes everyone's power-ups, instant power-ups, pending projectiles, all pickups on board and all projectiles on board.\r\n\r\nRoulette - A half black, half white circle.\r\nThis one is very useful, but sometimes dangerous.\r\nWhen used, it picks a random playing tank, dead or alive, and changes its state in the game.\r\nIf it's alive, it dies.\r\nIf it's dead, it gets revived.\r\nIt can be used even after dying and includes you, so it gives you a chance of coming back to life, or if you are already alive,\r\na chance of dying.\r\n\r\nSwitcher - Looks like two black arrows going one up, one down.\r\nThis is my favourite.\r\nWhen used, it causes you to switch places with the living tank closest to you.\r\nHowever, it looks as if you just switched colors.\r\nYou get the exact same position, the same rotation, and even the same power-up as the closest living tank.\r\nSo yes, if the closest living tank happens to have a power-up, you steal it.\r\nHowever if you have a power-up, that tank will steal it too.\r\nAND since it can be used even after being dead, yes, you can switch places with a living tank and kill it in the process, taking its life.\r\nNice.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, we're moving to the timed:\r\n\r\nMinimize - Looks like a small square surrounded by four arrows pointing at its corners.\r\nOh, it is great.\r\nIt makes you 3x smaller, so you can avoid bullets easily!\r\nAnd it also makes your fences tiny!\r\nLasts for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nSpeed Boost - Looks like a fast-forward button, with one arrow being red and the other being yellow.\r\nSpeeds you up according to the factor written in the settings, and also makes your turns sharper.\r\nLasts for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nTripler - Looks like an arrow splitting into 3 arrows.\r\nMakes you shoot 3 bullets at a time!\r\nAnd they don't even count towards you maximum!\r\n\r\nForce Field - Looks like a light blue circle.\r\nGives you a light blue aura, and causes you to be invincible.\r\nBUT if a normal bullet hits you, it bounces off of you and back to the sender!\r\nHowever, if you drive into a bullet, it will get stuck inside you since it will be going forwards-backwards-forwards-bacwards etc.\r\nLasts for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nExtra Life - Looks like a heart.\r\nGives you a spinning red halo, that gives you another life!\r\nIf a normal bullet hits you, it gets deflected off.\r\nWhen you are supposed to be killed, even by, say, roulette, you just lose that halo and stay alive!\r\nLasts indefinitely, until you are killed.\r\n(So that power-up is not even timed!)\r\n\r\nLock - Looks like a freaking lock.\r\nIt causes a random tank (that's not you) to not be able to move, shoot bullets or place fences.\r\nLasts for 3 seconds, and gives that power-up to the random tank - removes its current power-up if it has one.\r\n\r\nGhost - Looks like 3 black strips of bacon (I can't draw).\r\nYou can pass through fences and bullets. (They won't kill you.)\r\nLasts for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nConcealer - Looks like a question mark inside a white square - reminds the question mark box from Super Mario Bros.\r\nThis one is a little complicated.\r\nFor 10 seconds, you get the keys and color of a random living tank, so you kind of become a clone of that tank.\r\nBut the cool part about it, is that it either switches the tanks, or not.\r\nSo when one of the two tanks dies, it is impossible to tell whether is was you or the original tank.\r\nDuring those 10 seconds you lose control of your tank, but with a 50% increased chance of survival.\r\nIt's like an insurance.\r\nLasts for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we get to the appearing power-ups!\r\nThe appearing power-ups will seem unique and weird, because they pretty much are.\r\n\r\nPortal - Looks like a freaking portal. Even animated.\r\nYou come in one, you go out the other.\r\nBullets too.\r\nHowever, since I suck, It always teleports you to where you would go if you went forward, so if you go in backwards, you rapidly switch between portals.\r\nWill be fixed when I will care enough.\r\n\r\nAccelerator - Looks like the speed boost, except vertical and in a white box.\r\nWill give you a quick boost - 20x your speed for 0.1 seconds. \r\nYep, it is stupid.\r\n\r\nBlack Hole - Looks like a circle with black and white stripes coming out of its center. (You will know it is one when you see one.)\r\nThis one's awesome.\r\nIt sucks in all projectiles on board then explodes them out.\r\nIt only appears when there are projectiles on board.\r\nIt overloads at 50 bullets to keep players from constantly shooting bullets into it for hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n[PROJECTILES]\r\n\r\nYou can pick up some projectiles, then they will be the next thing you will shoot.\r\n\r\nExtreme bullet - Looks like a big black oval.\r\nDESTROYS everything in its path, but despawns when it hits a wall.\r\nI recommend shooting it while going backwards.\r\n\r\nHoming bullet - Like the normal bullet but red.\r\nHomes at the closest tank to it (EACH TICK - can change tanks if another tank gets closer).\r\nStarts homing after 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nMissile - A freaking missile.\r\nExplodes when should despawn, or a 10% chance that it explodes in your face!\r\nExplosions will be as big as the BlastRadius setting.\r\nAll tanks going into the explosion will be killed, with the exception of force fields and ghosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[SUDDEN DEATHS]\r\n\r\nDo not read this list if you want to be surprised!\r\n\r\n\r\nExplosion Death - Everyone go 'BOOM!'\r\n\r\nGlitchy Death/Awesome Death - \r\nThis one is weird. The tanks get to see their trails (like a HOM),\r\nthen random awesome faces appear, and after 10 seconds they rapidly fill the screen.\r\nThe tanks just die in the process for no logical reason.\r\n\r\nShrinking Death - Everyone get smaller until disappearing.\r\n\r\nHoley Death (PUN TOO AWESOME) - A black hole sucks EVERYTHING into it.\r\n\r\nHoming Death - 4 homing bullets come from the side.\r\nThis one can be dodged and if two tanks do, again, they just disappear after 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nPossession Death - Everyone starts shooting uncontrollably and the board is filled with bullets.\r\n\r\nSupernova Death - A black hole appears in the middle, then 4 stacks of bullets com from the corners and get sucked into the black hole, which causes an explosion of 360 bullets that create a circle that kills everyone.\r\nSeriously. No escape, unless you have the force field or ghost power-ups.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINISHING NOTES:\r\nYou will find a 'Fences' and 'Menu' Folder.\r\nThese are pending and will be implemented in a later update.\r\nI am new in GitHub, but i know C# for over 6 years and I really hope you enjoy this game, even though it's kinda complicated.\r\nThank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully play the game, and any comments will be appreciated.\r\nNitzan Bueno","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
